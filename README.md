Compartmental Models and Disease Dynamics of COVID-19

Senior capstone project for Applied Mathematics (MAT 189 UC DAVIS).

Modeling population dynamics of the current COVID-19 pandemic. We are focused on using compartmental models (SIR/SEIR) to study how sensitive the system is to varying initial conditions. We will implement agent-based modeling techniques to observe how various behaviors (i.e. the mandated shelter in place) and parameters effect disease dynamics. We also wish to propose an optimal method for vaccination (once a vaccination is available) to contain the pandemic.
